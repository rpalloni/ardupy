# ardupy
## Temperature/Humidity IoT project with Arduino+DHT22+Python3

Main purpose:
The project allows to monitor temperature, humidity and heat index using a DHT22 sensor connected to an Arduino board sending information to a basic Python server and available to clients within the same LAN through a simple web app. There are four project version of increasing complexity around the same idea.

Main learning concepts:
* basic network (LAN) concepts
* the IoT pipeline: from sensor signal to data storage/plot
* Arduino settings, libraries and sketch
* python3 server setup
* client-server model
* JavaScript and Ajax for data update
* data storage (file, db, JSON, Django JSONField() )
* data visualization (ChartJS, HighchartJS)

OS and dev tools:
* Linux Ubuntu 20.04
* Arduino IDE
* Atom IDE
* Django 3.1
